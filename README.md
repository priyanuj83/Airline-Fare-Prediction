# ‚úàÔ∏è Airline Market Fare Prediction App

This project builds a machine learning-based web application using Flask that predicts **average airline fares** based on key market and route-related factors. The model is trained on real airline data and optimized for performance using XGBoost.

## üß† Project Overview

- **Objective:** Predict the average fare of a flight route based on operational, market, and competition features.
- **Workflow:**
  - Data preprocessing and feature selection
  - Comparison of ANN, Random Forest, and XGBoost
  - Selection of top 10 important features
  - Final model deployment using Flask
- **End Result:** A lightweight and intuitive web application for predicting airline fares.

## üìà Model Comparison

| Model                         | RMSE ‚Üì  | R¬≤ Score ‚Üë | Notes                         |
|------------------------------|---------|------------|-------------------------------|
| **XGBoost (10 Features)**    | **5.53** | **0.9947**  | Best performance (final model)|
| Random Forest (500 Trees)    | 8.23    | 0.9882     | Solid, but less accurate      |
| ANN (2 Hidden Layers)        | 22.55   | 0.9041     | Performed worst               |

‚úÖ **Selected Model:** XGBoost trained on top 10 features due to its superior accuracy and generalization.
